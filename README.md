# MeTRoiDVaNiA

An experimental game made with Phaser.io and borrowing elements from classic games like Metroid and Castlevania. Obviously, this a spoof on the video game genre of the same name. Have fun and don't take yourself too seriously.

## Setup

Requires that you have nodeJs installed.

run `npm install` to install Phaser.io and Gulp package(s)

then run `gulp` to start the game in a bowser window
